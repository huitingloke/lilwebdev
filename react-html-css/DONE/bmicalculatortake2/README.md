*Accurate representation of my mental health*

Hi, this is my first React App that I've ever made after hastily flipping through a LinkedIn course. It truly was a crash course, not only because it was fast and efficient, but also because I now understand what it means to crash and burn.

This is a BMI calculator that I created with heavy referencing to my Notion notes from that tutorial. You might be thinking "Wow, Beth! How based!" But what I'm really thinking is whether this should be my career.

## Things to note (that may or may not have had a large impact on my day to day functioning)
* None of this is production ready
* The UI is ugly
* I really tried my best here, okay
* I am not sorry because this is my learning process

## How to obtain this?
All you need to do is to download these files, ensure you have `nodejs` installed, and voila! You now have access to 3 days worth of hard work. As usual, you can run this by `cd`ing into the entire folder and start it with `npm start`. Enjoy playing around with your BMI! Change whatever you want (the UI, please).

Please be my friend. I want friends. Thank you. Hit me up if you happen to play Brawlhalla and need a 2v2 partner in low Platinum. Or if you need me to boost you to Gold, or something. That can be arranged.
