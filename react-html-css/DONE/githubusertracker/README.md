# Github User Hireable Tracker (thing)
![Can't believe this project took as much time as it did](https://www.ggrecon.com/media/ul1elnqd/cannibal-toad-mario-theory.jpg?crop=0,0.19584383234691805,0,0.15090449077935786&cropmode=percentage&width=762&height=280&rnd=132972670017230000&format=webp&quality=50 "Thank you")
*Toad and Mario screaming in anguish upon seeing themselves being promoted as the unofficial mascot of my nightmares*

This was technically supposed to be my 4th project but I have lowkey internally scrapped the third project (some kind of task tracker) because I have been unable to sort out the functioning logic. I managed to do this project in under 3 hours total, to be honest. That's the only reason why I'm still standing.

## Things to improve on
* Mobile responsiveness, eventually. But really, I need to pickup Bootstrap or Tailwind or something at some point (let's be honest)
* The launch -- every time the user launches, they will see `The user you have searched for is unavailable!`, which isn't ideal but I have no idea how to set the useState to something else (how this works is it will send the username as an end to the link as an API request, so if there's nothing there, of course there wouldn't be a user...)
* The UI design: I really like gradients but I feel like it's too much right now... HAHAHA

## How to obtain this (I want this please)?
All you need to do is to download these files, ensure you have `nodejs` installed, and voila! You now have access to 3 hours worth of hard work. As usual, you can run this by `cd`ing into the entire folder and start it with `npm start`. You can update anything you would like, I honestly don't mind, just credit me if you were to use this for your own project as a starting base or something.

## Closing remarks

This is it, folks. Thanks for sticking around and reading this sloppily reformatted `README.md` file and maybe, just maybe, one day I will use these files for its intended purpose of providing genuinely useful information to someone who needs it. But, until then, you will have to deal with this adorable picture of an Enderman's boss getting absolutely dunk'd on.
