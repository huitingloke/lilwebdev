# Hi, it's me again

She's back, ladies and gentlemen. With more bad news, of course.

I made an app that let's you randomly generate gradient backgrounds using React, a touch of CSS and a splash of fonts.google.com (because who else would do something like this)! 

## Things to note
* None of this is production ready
* The UI is ugly
* I really tried my best here, okay
* I am not sorry because this is my learning process
* Chocolate tastes really good, but only dark chocolate and milk chocolate because technically white chocolate isn't real chocolate and to call it as such might be slightly cruel and unnerving

## How to obtain this?
All you need to do is to download these files, ensure you have `nodejs` installed, and voila! You now have access to 3 days worth of hard work. As usual, you can run this by `cd`ing into the entire folder and start it with `npm start`. You can update anything you would like, I honestly don't mind, just credit me if you were to use this for your own project as a starting base or something.

## Improvement vibes? 
There are definitely things that could have gone better, other than my attitude towards failure (this is a cry for help). I think one of the things which went wrong was when I put `useState` into the wrong component, trying to force data into the parent one instead of putting the data in the parent component to begin with and siphoning out the rest to the child.

The UI also doesn't look the best and this isn't exactly mobile responsive, but honestly since it's such a small project that uses centered divs I thought it wouldn't really matter that much. It kinda does. However, I don't want to remain hung up on this project for too long so if I ever come back to this, I will pay it more attention.

Third, and this is unrelated to the actual project (by much), I need to sort out my Github Desktop. Like, whew, please send help? Everything's messy and I might delete all my repos and start again because this looks extremely hopeless now.

## Closing remarks
![Thank you for tolerating me](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/fantendo/images/3/35/Lord_Toad.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20100722155906)
This is Toad from Mario. I would recommend you learn more about him through [this killer fanfiction right here](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12106395/1/Everybody-Hates-Toad). Synopsis: Toad just wanted to help Mario in his castle but wasn't paid enough for this. Well, I'm off. Please remind me to change this before I get an actual career.
