## Beth, you have finals in three weeks!
Can you not. I know. I know I have to wait until my impending doom because, whether I like it or not, half my life will be decided based on my GPA. However, I really enjoy creating these little apps with little APIs because they give me some form of joy in life. Please. Please let me have this. I'm begging you ple

## How do I use this marvellous application?

*I'm so glad you asked! And image is from Minecraft Christmas by Yogscast. I loveeeee Yogscast.*
* Step 1: Type in the name/ID of a Pokemon
* Step 2: Click the `check!` button
* Step 3: I promise I made all of the calculations using a homemade hash function which I adapted from `geeksforgeeks.com` so if you don't like how Eevee is 4/10 you can go ahead and blame them alright

## Can I use this for myself? 
Sure. Just credit where credit's due. Same rules apply.

## Parting words
I'm not dying but this really makes it sound like I am. Ummm have fun! Or don't. Like, it's really up to you, man. I don't tell you what to do.
