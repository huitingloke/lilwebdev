# Task Tracker
![Me when ReactJS](https://p16-sign-va.tiktokcdn.com/tos-useast2a-avt-0068-giso/046722296a53793a7f31fad840a7c81c~c5_720x720.jpeg?x-expires=1679439600&x-signature=5G1hnnygE1Obq%2F91S9LFhZFNMyk%3D)
*Thank you Sad Cat for always making me look like I'm happy. I owe you one.*

## How did we all end up here?
Wow! So cool! After creating a BMI calculator and later a gradient generating app, Beth had the brilliant idea of making a functional task tracker! I have never met anyone so ambitious yet so disappointingly unbrilliant. Come on, really. A task tracker. What's next, a Pomodoro timer?

*(I'm joking, self care is very important guys. 95% of what I say here is maximum trolling and is not intended to lower anyone else's self esteem further. Did you know it constitutes psychological harm if you make someone feel stupid? Well, now you do and can't plead ignorance. Haha. Loser.)*

## Things to note
* None of this is production ready
* I am somewhat proud of the UI here (I have had no formal training so please be nice)
* I like someone who doesn't like me back and I am coping by making more React apps to improve my coding skills in the hopes that one day, maybe, he will notice me and ask me for help in ReactJS development
* What? Ignore the third point

## How to obtain this (I want this please)?
All you need to do is to download these files, ensure you have `nodejs` installed, and voila! You now have access to 3 days worth of hard work. As usual, you can run this by `cd`ing into the entire folder and start it with `npm start`. You can update anything you would like, I honestly don't mind, just credit me if you were to use this for your own project as a starting base or something.

## Improvement vibes? 
Will be updated if I finish this project. If you find me crying like 8 minutes into the future, don't expect me to ship this out.

## Closing remarks

This is it, folks. Thanks for sticking around and reading this sloppily reformatted `README.md` file and maybe, just maybe, one day I will use these files for its intended purpose of providing genuinely useful information to someone who needs it. But, until then, you will have to deal with this adorable picture of an Enderman's boss getting absolutely dunk'd on.
