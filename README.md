## What's this repo for? 
Let's get into some history. I originally intended for this to be some kind of, like, HTML CSS practice dump which no one would ever see. If you're reading this, evidently I was wrong (because you're here). But as time went on and I forgot to make commits, I realized that I could just make this a giant storage collection dump thing of all my experiences e.g. React, Vanilla (which I haven't actually done), HTML, CSS etc

## Can I use the things here?
I mean, sure. Go ahead. Just credit where credit's due? Like feel free to expand on these projects because most of these are for practice anyway :3 Hope you enjoy messing around with it!
